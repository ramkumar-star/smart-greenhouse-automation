Objective:

    To automate the agriculture system.

    Smart farming deems it necessary to address the issues of population growth, climate change and labour.

    Smart farming decreases the time and increases production.

Abstract:

     Agriculture is the broadest economic sector and plays an important role in the overall economic development of a nation.

     Smart agriculture provides accurate farming and field evaluation.

     The measurement of physical parameters such as soil moisture content, temperature, etc…of the soil that plays a vital role in farming activities.

     Smart farming lowered operation cost.
 
 
 Description:
 
      Sensor data is stored to the cloud and then sends to the web application. 

NodeMCU:

      NodeMCU is a low cost open source IoT platform.
      
      It is a 32 bit Microcontroller unit.

Sensors:

      Sound sensor
      Barometer Sensor
      Light Sensor
      Water level Sensor
      Soil Moisture Sensor
      Rain drop Sensor
      Gas sensor
      UV sensor

Sound Sensor:

      Its measures the sound range of the insects like honey bees.

Barometer sensor:
  
      It is used in measure the atmospheric pressure and forecast.
      
Light Sensor :
  
      Check whether its day / night and if its night ,then give a plant growth light using LED.

Water level sensors :
      Used to check the level of water in tank .
      If the water level is low ,then automatically water is pumped into the tank.
      
Soil moisture sensor :
      Used to check the wetness of the soil.
      If the is wet ,then automatically water is pumped from the tank.
      
Rain drop sensor:
      Used to check whether its rainy and close the shutter. 
      
Gas sensors :
      Used to check whether the air is pure or not.
      Fans are used to remove the smoke gas.

UV sensor:
      Used to check the intensity of sunlight .

Cloud computing:
      Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. 
      Data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.
      There are several types of cloud platforms some the majorly used platforms are listed below:
      Firebase
      Microsoft Azure iot suit
      Amazon web service
      IBM Watson
      Oracle iot
      Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.
      There are two types of data base in firebase:
      Cloud fire store
      Real time database

DATA TRANSFER PROTOCOL:

      Types of protocols used in data transfer.
      HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
      MQTT(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
      
HTTP:
      Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is a request and response protocol between client & server.
      These are the disadvantages of the HTTP:
      Slower
      Over head
      Power consuming

MQTT:
      This protocol is designed as a lightweight messaging protocol that uses publish/subscribe operations to exchange data between clients and the server.
      These are the advantages of MQTT:
      MQTT is light weight protocol
      Minimized data packets
      Low power usage 
      Real time

Web application:

     The user interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. 

      It is also the way through which a user interacts with an application or a website.
